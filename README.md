# Azurenator

## What is the history of the project?

**Where did the idea come from?**

The idea was inspired by the game Akinator, which consists of a virtual genie who is able to guess the character the player is thinking of, whether real or not, by asking questions about their characteristics.

**Why do we care about this idea/area?**

Because it allows its users to focus more on their goals than on searching for tools and services in Azure.

## How it works?

Leveraging the power of Azure Bot Service development options, Azurenator interacts with the user to understand the goal to be achieved and then presents suggestions for Azure services that can collaborate with the expected solution. In addition to suggesting services, Azurenator can also provide solution-related assets, bringing no-code, low-code representations or even code examples and infrastructure as code that can be tested.
