# azurenator.github.io
Bringing together the power of Azure Bot Service, Language Understanding (LUIS), artificial intelligence and natural language, Azurenator interacts with the user to understand the goals to be achieved and then presents suggestions of Azure services that can collaborate with the expected solution. In addition to suggesting services, Azurenator can also provide solution-related assets, bringing no-code, low-code representations or even code examples and infrastructure as code that can be tested.
